# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with EmergentEmpires.ai in 15 minutes! This guide will walk you through creating your first empire and playing your initial turns.

## üöÄ Creating Your First Game

### Step 1: Choose Your Species
When starting a new game, you'll select your empire's species. For beginners, we recommend:

**üîß Builders** - Best for new players
- +20% construction speed makes development forgiving
- Reduced infrastructure costs mean more room for mistakes
- Visual progress through rapid building provides clear feedback

**Alternative**: üî¨ Researchers if you prefer technology-focused gameplay

### Step 2: Game Settings
For your first game, use these recommended settings:

- **Galaxy Size**: Small (25-50 systems) - easier to manage
- **Opponents**: 1-2 AI players on "Beginner" difficulty
- **Victory Conditions**: All enabled (gives you multiple paths to explore)
- **Turn Limit**: 300 turns (allows for learning without pressure)

### Step 3: Starting Position
You'll begin with:
- **Homeworld**: Your species' home planet with basic infrastructure
- **Starting Resources**: 1000 Energy, 800 Materials, 200 Knowledge
- **Initial Fleet**: 1 small exploration fleet with basic ships
- **Basic Technology**: Level 1 in Construction, Military, and Research

## üéØ Your First 10 Turns

### Turns 1-3: Immediate Priorities

**Turn 1: Scout and Assess**
1. **Explore**: Send your starting fleet to scout 2-3 nearby systems
2. **Review**: Check your homeworld's current infrastructure
3. **Plan**: Identify which nearby systems have valuable planets

**Turn 2: Begin Development**
1. **Build**: Start constructing an Energy Generator on your homeworld
2. **Research**: Begin researching "Advanced Construction" technology
3. **Monitor**: Check exploration results from your fleet

**Turn 3: Expand Infrastructure**
1. **Build**: Add a Materials Processing Plant to your homeworld
2. **Decision**: Choose your first colonization target based on scouting
3. **Prepare**: Start building a Colony Ship if you found a good planet

### Turns 4-6: Early Expansion

**Turn 4: Establish Second Colony**
1. **Colonize**: Send Colony Ship to your chosen target planet
2. **Develop**: Continue building infrastructure on homeworld
3. **Explore**: Send scouts to more distant systems

**Turn 5: Dual Planet Management**
1. **Homeworld**: Build advanced infrastructure (Research Lab)
2. **Colony**: Construct basic infrastructure (Energy Generator)
3. **Fleet**: Consider building a second exploration fleet

**Turn 6: Technology Focus**
1. **Complete**: Finish "Advanced Construction" research
2. **Start**: Begin researching either "Industrial Automation" or "Military Engineering"
3. **Build**: Start constructing more advanced buildings unlocked by tech

### Turns 7-10: Strategic Development

**Turn 7-8: Specialization Begins**
- **Economic Path**: Build advanced energy/material infrastructure
- **Military Path**: Construct shipyards and defensive fleets
- **Tech Path**: Focus on research facilities and knowledge generation

**Turn 9-10: Prepare for Mid-Game**
- **Assess**: Review other empires and their development
- **Plan**: Choose your primary victory condition focus
- **Build**: Start projects that support your chosen strategy

## üß† Basic Strategic Concepts

### Resource Management
- **Energy**: Powers all activities - never let it run too low
- **Materials**: Required for all construction - balance generation with needs
- **Knowledge**: Enables research - invest early for long-term advantages

### Development Priorities
1. **Turn 1-20**: Focus on basic infrastructure and exploration
2. **Turn 21-50**: Establish 3-4 colonies with specialized development
3. **Turn 51-100**: Choose strategic focus and build supporting infrastructure
4. **Turn 100+**: Execute chosen victory strategy while defending against opponents

### Fleet Management
- **Exploration Fleets**: Small, fast ships for scouting new systems
- **Colony Fleets**: Protected colony ships for expansion
- **Defense Fleets**: Balanced ships stationed at important systems
- **Attack Fleets**: Specialized military ships for conquest

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Beginner Mistakes

### Resource Management Errors
- **Energy Shortage**: Building too much too fast without energy infrastructure
- **Material Bottleneck**: Neglecting material generation while expanding rapidly
- **Knowledge Neglect**: Focusing only on immediate needs, ignoring research

### Strategic Mistakes  
- **Overexpansion**: Claiming too many planets without adequate development
- **Military Neglect**: Focusing purely on economy while neighbors build armies
- **Technology Lag**: Ignoring research while opponents gain technological advantages

### Tactical Errors
- **Undefended Colonies**: Leaving new planets vulnerable to attack
- **Poor Fleet Positioning**: Having all military ships in one location
- **Diplomatic Isolation**: Ignoring other empires until it's too late
