## 💰 Resource Management

### Income and Expenditure Tracking

**Income Sources**:
- Planet base generation
- Infrastructure bonuses
- Technology multipliers
- Trade agreements
- Diplomatic tributes

**Expenditure Categories**:
- Infrastructure maintenance (ongoing)
- Fleet upkeep (per ship, per turn)
- Construction projects (lump sum)
- Research projects (ongoing)
- Diplomatic activities (variable)

### Stockpiling and Reserves

**Storage Limits**:
- **Energy**: Limited storage, excess is lost each turn
- **Materials**: Can be stockpiled indefinitely
- **Knowledge**: Accumulated permanently (never lost)

**Strategic Reserves**:
- Maintain 3-5 turns of emergency energy reserves
- Stockpile materials for major construction projects
- Knowledge provides permanent competitive advantages

**Reserve Management**:
```
Emergency Reserves (minimum):
- Energy: 5x total maintenance costs
- Materials: 2x largest planned construction project
- Knowledge: Enough for next 2 research projects
```

### Resource Optimization

**Early Game Priorities**:
1. **Energy Self-Sufficiency**: Ensure energy income exceeds all costs
2. **Materials Foundation**: Build enough generation for steady expansion
3. **Knowledge Investment**: Establish research capability for technology advancement

**Mid Game Balance**:
1. **Specialized Planets**: Develop planets for optimal resource generation
2. **Technology Integration**: Use research to multiply resource efficiency
3. **Trade Networks**: Establish agreements to cover resource shortfalls

**Late Game Optimization**:
1. **Advanced Infrastructure**: Deploy highest-tier generation facilities
2. **System Integration**: Coordinate resource flows across entire empire
3. **Strategic Stockpiles**: Accumulate resources for decisive actions

## 🔄 Resource Conversion and Trade

### Internal Conversion
Some technologies allow limited resource conversion:

**Energy Conversion** (requires Advanced Power Systems):
- Convert 2 Materials → 3 Energy (emergency power)
- Convert 1 Knowledge → 5 Energy (research applications)

**Material Synthesis** (requires Molecular Assembly):
